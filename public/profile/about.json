    "about": " Hi! I'm Vaneesha S Kumar, a third-year undergraduate student currently pursuing a BS in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at IIT Kanpur.\n\nI have been obsessed with coding since the time I started and strive to become a first-class coder, constantly working towards that goal. And math? I love it—especially applied mathematics. Anything related to applied math, I can grasp firmly in little to no time. \n\nI am a driven individual who values punctuality and self-discipline deeply. My motto in life: Motivation is short-lived; you can't expect results with just that. Self-discipline is what makes you get up every day and follow the same routine, even when you don’t want to. I live by this motto and hope it will be fruitful.\n\n Apart from the nerdy stuff, I am a trained Bharatanatyam dancer with eight years of training, achieving 93% in my Junior Exam, and a trained Carnatic singer with eight years of experience. I am also a certified Potterhead and love reading fiction.\nCheers!",
